# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This is an early, experimental release, so bug reports from real use are just as valuable as code.

This fork brands the addon as **Herdr** and adds experimental native macOS support. Its original setup, **Omarchy 4.5.0**, **T3 Code Nightly** and **World of Warcraft: Forever** under Proton, remains supported. Keep both backends working and preserve the measured transport and controller constraints. See [docs/HERDR.md](docs/HERDR.md) for the current Herdr feature boundaries and verification gaps.

## Issues

Open an issue for a bug you can reproduce, or for a specific idea. Keep it detailed but straightforward: say what happened, plainly, and leave out the essay.

For a bug, include:

- **Versions**: your OS, Herdr (`herdr --version`), the bridge (`herdr-wow status`), Forever, and your controller if involved. Include T3 Code (`t3 --version`) and Omarchy (`omarchy-version`) when using that backend/setup.
- **What you did, what you expected, what happened instead.** Steps to reproduce if you have them.
- **`herdr-wow status --log`** output, and the text from `/herdr report` in game. Inspect screenshots and logs for private information before sharing.
- **A screenshot or short video** for anything you can see: a layout problem, a wrong state, a notice that didn't appear. It's often the fastest way to explain the problem.

One problem per issue. If you're not sure it's a bug, say so and describe what you saw.

## Pull requests

- **One problem per PR.** Small, focused changes get reviewed and merged faster.
- **Say what changes and why**, in plain terms. Link the issue if there is one.
- **Say how you verified it**: the tests you ran and what you checked in game, with what you saw. Mention anything you couldn't check. "Tests pass" alone isn't enough.
- **Show UI changes.** Anything you can see in game needs before and after screenshots, and a short recording when motion, timing, controller navigation or interaction is part of the change. Drag them into the PR description so GitHub hosts them; never commit screenshots or recordings to the repo. If nothing visible changes, one line saying why is enough.
- **Commits** should be atomic, with short messages that describe the change.
- AI-assisted contributions are fine. You're responsible for having read, run and checked the result, the same as any other change.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodyBontecou/t3code-wow
cd t3code-wow
./install.sh --backend herdr --no-service  # installs this checkout; run herdr-wow run afterward
```

After editing, run `./install.sh` from your checkout, then `/reload` in game. It copies your checkout over the installed copy, puts the addon into the game and restarts the bridge. (`herdr-wow sync` only re-copies the *installed* addon, so it won't pick up your edits.) New files inside the addon load on `/reload`; new addon folders (such as live-update slots) need a full game restart.

Tests:

```bash
cd bridge && npm test                                        # bridge, protocol, crypto, Lua/Node agreement
node tools/snapshot.mjs /tmp/t3snap.lua                      # a real snapshot from your running T3 Code
lua5.1 tools/smoke.lua addon/T3Code /tmp/t3snap.lua "$(cat /tmp/t3snap.view)"   # drive the addon headlessly
luajit tools/smoke.lua addon/T3Code /tmp/t3snap.lua "$(cat /tmp/t3snap.view)"   # same, with signed bit ops
```

`tools/wowstub.lua` stands in for the WoW API. Its widget methods come from the client's own API documentation, so calling a method that doesn't exist fails in tests the way it would in game.

Before changing how the addon and bridge talk, read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): several things that look like workarounds are deliberate, measured limits of the game client.

## Style

- Lua: tabs. JavaScript: two spaces, ES modules, no dependencies beyond Node itself.
- Text people see (in game, in the CLI, in docs) is plain and specific: say what happened and what to do, without jargon.

## Security

If you find a security problem, such as a way to send commands to someone's agents or read what they're sending, please report it privately through [GitHub's security advisories](https://github.com/ryanrhughes/t3code-wow/security/advisories/new) rather than a public issue.
